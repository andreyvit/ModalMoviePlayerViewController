# ModalMoviePlayerViewController

Display AVPlayerViewController the easy way, with controls initially hidden.

See [this StackOverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/a/36864440/58146) about the main problem this solves (hiding the controls); although it's also a very convenient class for showing videos with no fuss.
